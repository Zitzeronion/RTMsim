abstract = {Abstract An elegant procedure is proposed for obtaining components of the orthotropic or anisotropic in-plane permeability tensor from experimental data on flow front position and time. A radial flow geometry allows the shape of the advancing flow front to be dictated by the in-plane permeability of the fabric media. The directional permeabilities in the fabric plane are directly calculated from fluid and fabric properties together with data from the mold filling experiment (resin injection pressure and flow front position with time). The simplicity of the apparatus and proposed analytical procedure permit easy testing and comparison of different types of fibrous media.},

abstract = {Underwater explosions present many challenges for numerical modeling. The density ratio between explosion gases and the surrounding liquid are typically O(103), and the pressure ratios can be just as high. We develop a cell-centered finite volume method to solve the governing equations of a two-phase homogeneous fluid. Isentropic and isothermal equations of state are used to relate densities and pressure, in lieu of solving an energy equation. A volume fraction is used to distinguish between the disparate phases. A pressure-based, segregated algebraic solution procedure is used to solve for the primitive variables representing volume fraction, velocity, and piezometric pressure. Numerical examples include verification and validation for a number of canonical test cases. In particular, we examine an advecting material interface and show the absence of pressure oscillations across the contact discontinuity. The non-conservative form of our equations does not guarantee exact mass balance, but numerical experiments indicate that this dissipative mechanism has a stabilizing affect on the method. Shock tube and axisymmetric underwater explosion problems are presented to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm when very large density and pressure discontinuities are present. We simulate a shallow water explosion in three dimensions and examine the effects on the free surface and explosion bubble topology.}

abstract = {The equations describing the radial encroachment of a viscous liquid into a homogeneous, anisotropic porous medium are formulated and solved by two approximate methods. An analytical approximation is in good agreement with a finite element numerical solution, provided the angular component of the pressure gradient in an elliptical coordinate system is small. In the specific case where one of the principal flow directions is perpendicular to the flow plane, treatment of experimental flow data in accord with the analytical approximation determines the principal in-plane permeabilities and the degree of in-plane anisotropy. In the general case, the analysis yields effective permeabilities that are functions of the principal permeabilities and the orientation of the principal coordinate system.}
