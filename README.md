# RTMsim - Filling simulations in Resin Transfer Moulding with the Finite Area Method


## Summary
Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) is a manufacturing process for producing thin-walled fiber reinforced polymer composites where dry fibers are placed inside a mould and resin is injected under pressure into the fibrous preform. RTMsim is a robust, easy-to-use and simple-to-extend software tool, written in Julia, for RTM filling simulations. A shell mesh, injection pressure, resin viscosity and the parameters describing the preform are required input. The software was validated with results from literature as well as experiments and compared with results from well-established RTM filling simulation tools.


## Simulation workflow

### Mesh preparation

The new simulation tool does not include mesh generation. A mesh with the pre-defined regions must be generated with a meshing tool before starting the filling simulation. The authors used Altair HyperWorks but also free software tools like SALOMEMECA, GMSH or NETGEN can be used.

The shell mesh is created on the part's mid-surface. Mid-surface models are often available in composite manufacturing since computational stress analysis for thin-walled parts is performed on the partâ€™s mid-surface too. 

The prepared shell mesh is imported via a text file where nodes, elements and element sets are described in a format similar to the NASTRAN bulk data format. Every line contains ten fields of eight characters each. The first field contains the character name of the item. The input file for the permeameter reads:
```
SET 1 = 1,2,3,4,5,6,
7,8,9,10,11,12,
13,14,15,16
GRID 1 0.0 0.0 0.0
GRID 3 0.3 0.3 0.0
GRID 4 -0.3 0.3 0.0
[...]
GRID 331 -2.115-2-.113318 0.0
GRID 332 -.117148.1562872 0.0
GRID 333 .2271322.1925105 0.0
CTRIA3 1 0 15 9 16
CTRIA3 2 0 16 10 19
CTRIA3 3 0 19 11 17
[...]
CTRIA3 586 0 243 302 332
CTRIA3 587 0 262 333 259
CTRIA3 588 0 232 259 333
```
Nodes are described by the keyword `GRID`, followed by a grid number, followed by a blank and three fileds with the x, y and z coordinates of the node. The triangular cells are defined by the keyword `CTRIA3`, followed by a cell number, followed by a zero, followed by the three node numbers which constitute the cell. Nodes and elements need not be sorted nor starting with one. Cell sets are defined by the keyword `SET` followed by ` N = ` and the cell numbers separated by commas. Not more than 6 cell numbers per line. If another line is required for additional cell numbers, these follow after 8 blanks. Up to four sets can be defined. 

### Input parameters

RTMsim is executed with a well-defined list of parameters specified in an input text file or in the GUI. The following figure shows the GUI with explaination for the parameters. The buttons in the first line on the LHS are used for mesh inspection, i.e. select a mesh file, plot the mesh with bounding box and plot the defined sets. The buttons in the second line on the LHS are used to start and continue the simulation. The maximum simulation time and the type and properties of the defined sets must be set before. With the buttons in the third line one can select inlet ports with specified radius interactively in addition to using the defined sets, and start and continue such a simulation. The buttons in the forth line are used for post-processing, i.e. show filling and pressure distribution of a specified output file (final results in saven in results.jld2), plot filling at four equidistant time instances and filling at several time instances which are selected with a slider bar. The buttons in the line on the RHS are used to start the simulation with the parameters from the selected text input file.

### Run simulation

In order to use RTMsim follow the following steps:
- Download Julia from https://julialang.org/downloads/ and add Julia to path such that can be started from command line.
- Open Julia terminal, change to package manager with `]` and `add Gtk GLMakie Makie NativeFileDialog Glob LinearAlgebra JLD2 GeometryBasics Random FileIO ProgressMeter`.
- Go to the directory with the RTMsim repository and double click on run_rtmsim_GUI.bat. 

Alternatively, open Julia terminal, go to the directory with the RTMsim repository with `cd("path")` and start with `include("rtmsim_GUI.jl")` or `include("rtmsim.jl")`. There one has direct access to all functions, e.g.

## Validation and verification

Five different test cases are available, successfully validating the Julia implementation of the RTM filling model:
1. Validation of the software for radial flow with isotropic in-plane peremablity: The simulated flow front position after 200 s is compared with the calculated flow front postion from literature.  
2. Verification of the software for radial flow with tilted orthotropic in-plane permeablity: The simulated tilted elliptical flow front is analysed and the calculated orthotropic permeablity is compared with the input (K, alpha, theta).
3. Comparison of the simulated flow front position for a complex annulus filler-like part with the simulated flow front position with Ansys Fluent and comparison of the simulated filling pattern with results from a myRTM simulation.
4. Validation with experimental data from a radial permeameter experiment with two patches with different in-plane permeability and porosity levels. This comparison and guidelines for performing reliable filling simulations (e.g. mesh refinement) will be discussed in a follow-up paper.

The following pictures show the validation results for cases 1, 2 and 3.

<img src="validation_pic2.png" width="600">

The input files for the four validation cases are `input_case1_coarsemesh.txt`, `input_case1_finemesh.txt`, `input_case2_coarsemesh.txt`, `input_case2_finemesh.txt`, `input_case3_coarsemesh.txt`, `input_case3_finemesh.txt, input_case4.txt`.

# Future work

The source code is prepared for the following extensions:
- Import mesh file in different format. Selection is based on the extension of the mesh file.
- Input parameter `i_model` (for iso-thermal RTM `=1`) is used for adding additional functionalities. E.g. adding temperature and degree-of-cure equations with variable resin viscosity ar for VARI with variable porosity and permeability.
- Parameter `i_method` in the functions for numerical differentiation and flux functions can be used to implement different numerical schemes. E.g. gradient limiter or second-order upwinding.
